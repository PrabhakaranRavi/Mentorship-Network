## Introduction

This app was born out of a desire to add value to our communities, especially in rural regions, where many are unaware of platforms like LinkedIn or tech communities. The goal is to bridge this gap by connecting individuals through a simple and intuitive interface.

## Inspiration

The idea for this app was sparked by a talk given by **Vignesh Annamalai** on solving problems in Tirunelveli. His insights into how engineers can make a significant impact on society and the real-life stories he shared were incredibly moving. This led me to think about how I could contribute to my community and beyond.

Through various tech events, I've had the privilege of meeting incredible individuals, from students building startups to seasoned professionals. However, I noticed that many people in my hometown of Madurai and other regions aren't aware of LinkedIn or tech communities. This app is my attempt to bridge that gap and connect people who are eager to provide guidance and mentorship.

## Features

- **Connect with Nearby Individuals**: View a map showing people in your vicinity who are part of the tech community.
- **LinkedIn Integration**: Each profile links directly to the individual's LinkedIn, making it easier to connect professionally.
- **Community Building**: Designed to help individuals from Tamil Nadu to Karnataka and beyond connect and share knowledge.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Leaflet**: An open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
- **Supabase**: A backend service to manage and store user data.
